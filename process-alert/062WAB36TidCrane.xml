# What you should consider doing now

- Flood water may still be around for several days. Take care as there may be hidden dangers in the flood water like sharp objects, raised manhole covers and pollution.
- Only return to evacuated buildings if it is safe to do so.
- If you have been flooded, ring your buildings and contents insurance company as soon as possible. In almost all cases they will send a loss adjuster to look at your property. They will confirm what repairs and replacements are needed and covered by your policy.

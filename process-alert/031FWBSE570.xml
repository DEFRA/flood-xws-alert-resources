    <description>A flood warning has been issued.  River levels are forecast to rise at the Gloucester river gauge as a result of high spring tides coinciding with high river levels.  Flooding is possible on high tides at Gloucester over the next few days.  We expect flooding to affect Coal Wharf and Riverside, Maisemore, low lying areas on Base Lane, Sandhurst. Sandhurst Lane will be just passable. The A417 at Maisemore may be closed due to flooding. Predicted Peaks:- Sandhurst 3.4m to 3.6m 03/03/22 at 22:30 and 3.6m to 3.8m on 04/03/22 at 10:30, Gloucester 3.5m to 3.7m 03/03/22 at 22:15 and 3.6m to 3.8m 04/03/22 at 10:30.   
We expect river levels to remain high over the next 4 days.
We are closely monitoring the situation.  Our incident response staff are checking defences.  
Please plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.  
This message will be updated by 14:00 on 04/03/22, or as the situation changes.</description>

# What you should consider doing now

- Act on your flood plan if you have one.
- Move your family and pets to a safe place.
- Move your car or other vehicles to higher ground, if it is safe to do so.
- Use flood protection equipment, such as flood barriers, air brick covers and pumps to protect your property. Any equipment should be professionally supplied and installed to help reduce the impact of flood water.
- Move important items upstairs or to a safe place in your property, starting with cherished items of personal value that you will not be able to replace (such as family photographs). Next move valuables (such as computers), movable furniture and furnishings.
- You may need to leave your property, so pack a bag with enough items for a few nights away. Include essential items including a torch with spare batteries, mobile phone and charger, warm clothes, home insurance information, water, food, first aid kit and any prescription medicines or baby care items you may need.
- Turn off gas, electricity and water mains supplies before flood water starts to enter your property. Never touch an electrical switch if you are standing in water.
- If it is safe to do so, make sure neighbours are aware of the situation and offer help to anyone who may need it.
- Listen to the advice of the emergency services and be ready to evacuate your property if told to do so. Most evacuation centres will let you bring your pets.
- Avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water - 30 cm of fast-flowing water can move a car and 6 inches can knock an adult off their feet.
- Flood water is dangerous and may be polluted. Wash your hands thoroughly if youâ€™ve been in contact with it.

##### Businesses

- Act on your business flood plan if you have one.
- Move your staff and customers to a safe place.
- Move stock and other valuable items upstairs or to a safe place in your building.
